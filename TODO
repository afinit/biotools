We cannot resume prok-geneseek at the variance step, there needs to be a way to
pair a nucleotide file with its amino acid counterpart without relying on 
interleaving the files (so that if you choose to resume at that point you can 
do e.g. 
prok-geneseek --no-predict --no-cluster --no-rename [other options] \
  dir/*/*.fasta.
