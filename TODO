Remove reliance on proprietary 'fastc' file format in biotools.analysis.predict; instead, it should be writing 'fasta' files and biotools.analysis.cluster should be concerned with making the initial clusters.

Refactor biotools.analysis.cluster; make biotools.clustalw specifically for running clustalw

We cannot resume prok-geneseek at the variance step, there needs to be a way to pair a nucleotide file with its amino acid counterpart without relying on interleaving the files (so that if you choose to resume at that point you can do e.g. prok-geneseek --no-predict --no-cluster --no-rename [other options] dir/*/*.fasta).
